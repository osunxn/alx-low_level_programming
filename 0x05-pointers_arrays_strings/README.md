## Description

In this topic, we learn about pointers, arrays, and strings in the C programming language. We explore concepts such as memory addresses, pointer arithmetic, array declaration and initialization, string manipulation functions, and more.

## Files

- [0-reset_to_98.c](./0-reset_to_98.c): Function that takes a pointer to an int as a parameter and updates the value it points to 98.
- [1-swap.c](./1-swap.c): Function that swaps the values of two integers.
- [2-strlen.c](./2-strlen.c): Function that returns the length of a string.
- [3-puts.c](./3-puts.c): Function that prints a string to stdout.
- [4-print_rev.c](./4-print_rev.c): Function that prints a string in reverse.
- [5-rev_string.c](./5-rev_string.c): Function that reverses a string.
- [6-puts2.c](./6-puts2.c): Function that prints one char out of 2 of a string, followed by a new line.
- [7-puts_half.c](./7-puts_half.c): Function that prints the second half of a string.
- [8-print_array.c](./8-print_array.c): Function that prints n elements of an array of integers.
- [9-strcpy.c](./9-strcpy.c): Function that copies the string pointed to by src, including the terminating null byte, to the buffer pointed to by dest.

## Usage

You can use the provided source code files as a reference or implement your own solutions based on the task requirements.

To compile the C files, you can use a C compiler such as `gcc`. For example, to compile `0-reset_to_98.c` and create an executable named `reset`, run the following command:

```shell
gcc -Wall -Wextra -Werror -pedantic 0-reset_to_98.c -o reset
Replace 0-reset_to_98.c with the desired source code file.

To run the compiled executable, use the command ./reset (assuming you named the executable reset).

Feel free to explore and modify the code to enhance your understanding of the topic.
5. Save the file (`Ctrl + O` in `nano`), and exit the text editor (`Ctrl + X` in `nano`).
