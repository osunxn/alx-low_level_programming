## Description
This project is part of the Holberton School curriculum and focuses on pointers, arrays, and strings in C programming language.

## Files
* [0-memset.c](./0-memset.c): C function that fills memory with a constant byte.
* [1-memcpy.c](./1-memcpy.c): C function that copies memory area.
* [2-strchr.c](./2-strchr.c): C function that locates a character in a string.
* [3-strspn.c](./3-strspn.c): C function that gets the length of a prefix substring.
* [4-strpbrk.c](./4-strpbrk.c): C function that searches a string for any of a set of bytes.
* [5-strstr.c](./5-strstr.c): C function that locates a substring.
* [7-print_chessboard.c](./7-print_chessboard.c): C function that prints the chessboard.
* [8-print_diagsums.c](./8-print_diagsums.c): C function that prints the sum of the two diagonals of a square matrix of integers.

## Usage
To compile the C files, you can use the following command:
gcc -Wall -pedantic -Werror -Wextra -std=gnu89 file_name.c -o executable_file

Replace `file_name.c` with the name of the C file you want to compile and `executable_file` with the desired name of the resulting executable file.

After compiling, you can run the executable file using the following command:
Replace `executable_file` with the name of the compiled executable file.
