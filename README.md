# Low-Level Programming in C

This repository contains resources and examples for low-level programming in the C programming language.

## Introduction

Low-level programming involves working with the hardware and low-level systems of a computer. It requires a deep understanding of computer architecture, memory management, and system-level programming. C is one of the most popular languages for low-level programming due to its close relationship with the underlying hardware.

## Contents

- **Introduction to Low-Level Programming**: An overview of low-level programming concepts and its importance in system development.
- **Memory Management**: Exploring memory allocation, deallocation, and manipulation techniques in C.
- **Bit Manipulation**: Understanding bitwise operations and their applications in low-level programming.
- **Pointer Arithmetic**: Exploring pointer arithmetic and its role in direct memory manipulation.
- **File I/O**: Working with files at a low-level using C's file I/O functions.
- **System Calls**: Interacting with the operating system through system calls to perform low-level tasks.
- **Assembly Language**: Introduction to assembly language programming and its integration with C.

## Examples

This repository includes practical examples to demonstrate low-level programming techniques in C. Each example is well-documented and provides clear explanations of the underlying concepts.

1. **Example 1**: Memory allocation using `malloc()` and `free()`.
2. **Example 2**: Bitwise manipulation for efficient data storage.
3. **Example 3**: Pointer arithmetic to traverse and manipulate arrays.
4. **Example 4**: Reading and writing binary files using low-level file I/O functions.
5. **Example 5**: Invoking system calls to perform low-level operations.
