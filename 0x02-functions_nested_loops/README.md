# 0x02. C - Functions, nested loops

This repository contains solutions to the tasks of the **0x02. C - Functions, nested loops** project at ALX-Software Engineering School.

## Files

The following files are present in this repository:

### 0. _putchar

- File: `_putchar.c`, `main.c`
- The program prints `_putchar`, followed by a new line.

### 1. I sometimes suffer from insomnia. And when I can't fall asleep, I play what I call the alphabet game

- File: `1-alphabet.c`, `main.c`
- The function `print_alphabet` prints the alphabet in lowercase, followed by a new line.

### 2. 10 x alphabet

- File: `2-print_alphabet_x10.c`, `main.c`
- The function `print_alphabet_x10` prints the alphabet in lowercase ten times, followed by a new line.

### 3. islower

- File: `3-islower.c`, `main.c`
- The function `_islower` checks if a character is lowercase.
- Returns 1 if the character is lowercase, and 0 otherwise.

### 4. isalpha

- File: `4-isalpha.c`, `main.c`
- The function `_isalpha` checks if a character is alphabetic.
- Returns 1 if the character is a letter (lowercase or uppercase), and 0 otherwise.

### 5. Sign

- File: `5-sign.c`, `main.c`
- The function `print_sign` prints the sign of a number.
- Returns 1 and prints '+' if the number is greater than zero.
- Returns 0 and prints '0' if the number is zero.
- Returns -1 and prints '-' if the number is less than zero.

### 6. There is no such thing as absolute value in this world. You can only estimate what a thing is worth to you

- File: `6-abs.c`, `main.c`
- The function `_abs` computes the absolute value of an integer.
- Returns the absolute value of the integer.

### 7. There are only 3 colors, 10 digits, and 7 notes; it's what we do with them that's important

- File: `7-print_last_digit.c`, `main.c`
- The function `print_last_digit` prints the last digit of a number.
- Returns the value of the last digit.

### 8. I'm federal agent Jack Bauer, and today is the longest day of my life

- File: `8-24_hours.c`, `main.c`
- The function `jack_bauer` prints every minute of the day of Jack Bauer from 00:00 to 23:59.

### 9. Learn your times table

- File: `9-times_table.c`, `main.c`
- The function `times_table` prints the 9 times table, starting from 0.

### 10. a + b

- File: `10-add.c`, `main.c`
- The function `add` adds two integers and returns the result.

### 11. 98 Battery Street, the OG

- File: `11-print_to_98.c`, `main.c`
- The function `print_to_98` prints all natural numbers from a given number up to 98.

### 12. The World looks like a multiplication-table, or a mathematical equation, which, turn it how you will, balances itself

- File: `100-times_table.c`, `main.c`
- The function `print_times_table` prints the n times table, starting from 0.
- Only prints the table if n is greater than or equal to 0 and less than or equal to 15.

### 13. Nature made the natural numbers; All else is the work of women

- File: `101-natural.c`, `main.c`
- The program computes and prints the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1024 (excluded), followed by a new line.

### 14. In computer class, the first assignment was to write a program to print the first 100 Fibonacci numbers. Instead, I wrote a program that would steal passwords of students. My teacher gave me an A

- File: `102-fibonacci.c`, `main.c`
- The program prints the first 50 Fibonacci numbers, starting with 1 and 2, followed by a new line.

### 15. Even Liber Abbaci

- File: `103-fibonacci.c`, `main.c`
- The program finds and prints the sum of the even-valued terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed 4,000,000, followed by a new line.

### 16. In computer class, the first assignment was to write a program to print the first 100 Fibonacci numbers. Instead, I wrote a program that would steal passwords of students. My teacher gave me an A+

- File: `104-fibonacci.c`, `main.c`
- The program finds and prints the first 98 Fibonacci numbers, starting with 1 and 2, followed by a new line.

## Requirements

- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89
- All your files should end with a new line
- A `README.md` file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
- Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using `betty-style.pl` and `betty-doc.pl`
- You are not allowed to use global variables
- No more than 5 functions per file
- You are not allowed to use the standard library. Any use of functions like printf, puts, etc. is forbidden
- You are allowed to use `_putchar`
- You don’t have to push `_putchar.c`, we will use our file. If you do it won’t be taken into account
- The prototypes of all your functions and the prototype of the function `_putchar` should be included in your header file called `main.h`
- Don’t forget to push your header file
