# 0x01. C - Variables, if, else, while

This directory contains programs written in the C programming language as part of the ALX Low-Level Programming curriculum. The programs cover various concepts related to variables, if-else statements, and while loops.

## Files

- **0-positive_or_negative.c**: This program checks if a randomly generated number is positive or negative and prints the result.

- **1-last_digit.c**: This program prints the last digit of a randomly generated number and determines if it is greater than 5, less than 6 but not 0, or 0.

- **2-print_alphabet.c**: This program prints the lowercase alphabet using a while loop.

- **3-print_alphabets.c**: This program prints both the lowercase and uppercase alphabets using a while loop.

- **4-print_alphabt.c**: This program prints the lowercase alphabet excluding the letters q and e using a while loop.

- **5-print_numbers.c**: This program prints single-digit numbers using a while loop.

- **6-print_numberz.c**: This program prints single-digit numbers without using the variable `char` and using only the `putchar` function.

- **7-print_tebahpla.c**: This program prints the lowercase alphabet in reverse order using a while loop.

- **8-print_base16.c**: This program prints all the numbers of base 16 in lowercase using a while loop.

- **9-print_comb.c**: This program prints all possible combinations of single-digit numbers using a while loop and without repeating any combination.

- **10-print_comb2.c**: This program prints all possible combinations of two-digit numbers using nested while loops.

- **100-print_comb3.c**: This program prints all possible combinations of two different digits using nested while loops and without repeating any combination.

- **101-print_comb4.c**: This program prints all possible combinations of three different digits using nested while loops and without repeating any combination.

- **102-print_comb5.c**: This program prints all possible combinations of two two-digit numbers using nested while loops and without repeating any combination.

- **holberton.h**: Header file containing function prototypes used in the programs.

## Requirements

The programs are written in C and compiled using gcc 4.8.4 on Ubuntu 14.04. They may not run on other systems without adjustments.

Feel free to edit the code in your desired IDC

To compile the programs, use the following command:

gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic *.c -o <output_file>



Replace `<output_file>` with the desired name for the compiled program.

## Usage

After compiling a program, run it using the following command:
./<compiled_program>


Replace `<compiled_program>` with the name of the compiled program.

The program will then execute and display the output accordingly.
