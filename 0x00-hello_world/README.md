# 0x00-hello_world

This repository contains introductory projects in the C programming language as part of the "0x00-hello_world" curriculum.

## Description

The "0x00-hello_world" project is designed to introduce you to the basics of the C programming language and familiarize you with the process of compiling and running C programs. It covers essential concepts such as writing a "Hello, World!" program, using printf for output, compiling with gcc, and understanding the main function.

## Projects

The "0x00-hello_world" project consists of the following tasks:

1. **0-preprocessor**: Writing a script that runs a C file through the preprocessor and saves the result.
2. **1-compiler**: Writing a script that compiles a C file but does not link it.
3. **2-assembler**: Writing a script that generates the assembly code of a C code file.
4. **3-name**: Writing a script that compiles a C file and creates an executable named cisfun.
5. **4-puts.c**: Writing a C program that prints a specific string using the puts function.
6. **5-printf.c**: Writing a C program that prints a specific string using the printf function.
7. **6-size.c**: Writing a C program that prints the size of various data types on the computer it is compiled and run on.
8. **100-intel**: Writing a script that generates the assembly code (Intel syntax) of a C code file and saves it in an output file.
