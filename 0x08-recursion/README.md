## Description

This repository contains solutions to the "0x08. C - Recursion" project of the Low-Level Programming section of the ALX-Holberton School.

Each task has its own corresponding C file with the following descriptions:

### Task 0: She locked away a secret, deep inside herself, something she once knew to be true... but chose to forget

- Prototype: `void _puts_recursion(char *s);`

### Task 1: Why is it so important to dream? Because, in my dreams, we are together

- Prototype: `void _print_rev_recursion(char *s);`

### Task 2: Dreams feel real while we're in them. It's only when we wake up that we realize something was actually strange

- Prototype: `int _strlen_recursion(char *s);`

### Task 3: You mustn't be afraid to dream a little bigger, darling

- Prototype: `int factorial(int n);`

### Task 4: Once an idea has taken hold of the brain it's almost impossible to eradicate

- Prototype: `int _pow_recursion(int x, int y);`

### Task 5: Your subconscious is looking for the dreamer

- Prototype: `int _sqrt_recursion(int n);`

### Task 6: Inception. Is it possible?

- Prototype: `int is_prime_number(int n);`

### Task 7: They say we only use a fraction of our brain's true potential. Now that's when we're awake. When we're asleep, we can do almost anything

- Prototype: `int is_palindrome(char *s);`

### Task 8: Inception. Now, before you bother telling me it's impossible...

- Prototype: `int wildcmp(char *s1, char *s2);`

## Usage

Each task has a corresponding C file in the repository. To compile the C files, use the following format:

```bash
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic <C_FILE> -o <OUTPUT_FILE>
./<OUTPUT_FILE>

Please note that you need to replace the `<C_FILE>` and `<OUTPUT_FILE>` placeholders with the appropriate values when compiling and running the C files. Additionally, replace the GitHub repository URL and author information with the correct details for your project.
